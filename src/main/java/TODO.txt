-- Want to add up to Pewter City
    -- mart
    -- bag
    -- Gyms
        -- How do badges affect things?
            -- e.g. mart selection
    -- pokédex implementation?
    -- battle mode improvements
        -- ensure keyboard navigation

- Continue to add Pokémon
    -- Remember to add new mons to PokémonFactory and Species

- Continue to refine Battle.java
    -- ability/effect implementations
        -- as i add more moves/mons
        -- remember to add these moves to movesets
    -- Moves to implement:
         -- Mirror move is prob bad
            -- update: Mirror Move is officially broken, as it needs to target a specific Slot to get it's last move used
                -- how do I determine which Slot to get?
        -- Flame Burst has an extra effect in double battles I haven't implemented yet
        -- I don't think status moves are checked for type ineffectiveness (i.e. poison moves vs. steel types)
            -- glare is special and can hit ghosts
        -- Helping Hand's effect isn't implemented yet
        -- MultiStrikeMoves shouldn't have an equal probability of every number of hits (as in, they do currently in the code, but not in the real game)
        -- Sucker Punch is broken, since it used an outdated mechanism to determine if it would succeed
                 -- partially fixed; will now fail if the target is not using an Attack, but will always succeed if they are
                 -- maybe assign each battle slot a turn number and see whose turn is first?
    -- awardEXP is a little wonky, but it should work for now


-- Infrastructure for mart is all set up, just need to actually write the code to buy and sell

-- Items

-- Implement scrolling text for the game frame
