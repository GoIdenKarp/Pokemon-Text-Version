- Continue to add Pokémon
    -- Remember to add new mons to PokémonFactory and Species

- Continue to refine Battle(Redux).java
    -- ability/effect implementations
        -- as i add more moves/mons
        -- remember to add these moves to movesets
    -- Moves to implement:
         -- Mirror move is prob bad
            -- update: Mirror Move is officially broken, as it needs to target a specific Slot to get it's last move used
                -- how do I determine which Slot to get?
        -- Flame Burst has an extra effect in double battles I haven't implemented yet
        -- I don't think status moves are checked for type ineffectiveness (i.e. poison moves vs. steel types)
            -- glare is special and can hit ghosts
        -- Helping Hand's effect isn't implemented yet
        -- MultiStrikeMoves shouldn't have an equal probability of every number of hits (as in, they do currently in the code, but not in the real game)
        -- Sucker Punch is broken, since it used an outdated mechanism to determine if it would succeed
                 -- partially fixed; will now fail if the target is not using an Attack, but will always succeed if they are
                 -- maybe assign each battle slot a turn number and see whose turn is first?
    -- awardEXP is a little wonky, but it should work for now

-- Saving and loading the game
    -- This works now!
    --rework generating regions
        -- Eventually Gyms are gonna have to be a thing
        -- I have no way of accounting for the different kinds of Fishing Rods

-- Player should have a way to check their party

-- Want to add up to Pewter City

-- Player now has a field for a caught Pokémon
    -- check for this field to have a value after battle -> move to Game's PC field

-- Infrastructure for mart is all set up, just need to actually write the code to buy and sell

-- Items

-- Note to self: Side was setting Slot's Actions to null at the end of each turn. This was breaking the extra-move turns,
      so I disabled it. I'm not sure it's needed, but I should look out for any bugs it could be causing.

-- Implement scrolling text for the game frame

-- Pokémon is null when losing first battle?
